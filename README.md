# TotalBattleApp
Allows doing automatic mouse operations. Currently, there are two functions. Autoclicking (eg: for opening tons of daily jobs). Auto crypter for **common** and **epic** crypts (rare needs additional click for opening, will implement in future).

## Technology stack
**Kotlin, Swing, Gradle**

## Prerequisites
Be able to run java program. To do this you must install JDK (java development kit). Yes for just running java program, JRE (java runtime environment) is enough (advanced people can try it). But because I am programmer I am using JDK and I didn't try that just with JRE.

So install JDK17.

### MacOS

[Here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-mac)

I would go with DMG installer. Use appropriate version based on your processor architecture. x64 vs arm64 (M1, M2 processors)

### Windows
[Here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows)

When installation is successful you would be able to run command line with command below:
> java - version

And it prints correctly your new installed java version 17. Here is just sample about mine java 19:
```
openjdk version "19.0.2" 2023-01-17
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu19.32+13-CA (build 19.0.2+7)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu19.32+13-CA (build 19.0.2+7, mixed mode, sharing)
```
